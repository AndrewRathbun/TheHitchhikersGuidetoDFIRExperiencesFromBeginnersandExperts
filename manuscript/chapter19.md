# Chapter 19 - Linux and Digital Forensics

## What is Linux?

There are a plenty of resources on the
    - forensic perspective
    - what it's not

### Distributions
    - what are distributions
    
#### Simple vs. Easy
    - forensic perspective
   
#### Choosing Your Platform
    - Any distribution (within reason)
    - Requirements
    - baseline or Ready out of the box
    - Bootable vs installed
    - baremetal vs VM

## Why Linux for Digital Forensics

### Education
    - free tools
    - online support (non vendor)
    - cli teaches "bits and bytes"
     
### Free(dom)!
    - flexibility to install as many times as you like
    - lab setup

### Control
    - granular control over devices, drivers, etc.
    - not as exlusive as it once was
    
### Cross Verification - An Alternate OS Approach
    - Using Linux in conjuction with Windows

## Learning Linux
    - forensic perspecitve
    - Lots of resources
    - Be wary of non-forensic advice for forensic issues
    
## Learning Linux Forensics
    - What is your purpose for using linux?

#### Linux as a Platform
    - if it is for learning forensics, you can try the linuxleo guide
    - watch windows forensics videos and see how you can apply linux
    - use it!

#### Linux as a target
    - There are books available, and more to come as linux growth on the
      desktop grows and server use increases.
    - Analysing an OS generally requires knowledge of how it works.
        - This can be made difficult by distribution differences,
          configuration differences, file system selection, etc.
        - baseline knowledge is a good base.
