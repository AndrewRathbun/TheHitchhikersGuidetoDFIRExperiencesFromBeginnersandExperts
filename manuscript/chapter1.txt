## History of the Digital Forensics Discord Server

I felt it was prudent to choose this topic for this project because very few others could provide as in depth of an account on the history of the Digital Forensics Discord Server. More to come in this section.

### Beginnings in IRC

Long before the Digital Forensics Discord Server came to be, there existed a channel on an [IRC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat) network called [freenode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freenode). The channel was called `#mobileforensics`. This channel had its humble beginnings on a Google Group ran by Bob Elder of [TeelTech](https://www.teeltech.com/), called the [Physical and RAW Mobile Forensics Group](https://groups.google.com/g/physical-mobile-forensics/about?pli=1), which still exists today. In order to gain access to this Google Group, one had to have attended a TeelTech training in the past. It was, and continues to be, a phenomenal resource for those of us in Law Enforcement trying to navigate the waters of mobile forensic acquisitions. 

By way of background, In February 2016 I attended the JTAG/Chip-Off class by TeelTech taught by Mike Boettcher and gained an invite to the Physical and RAW Mobile Forensics Group. I actively participated in the group to the extent my knowledge and curiosity enabled me. Make no mistake about, almost every other active poster in that group was more experienced or knowledgeable than myself. However, I thought to myself that there was no better place to immerse myself in or people to surround myself with than this group if I wanted to be the best version of myself.

On August 23, 2016, a user that went by the name of `tupperwarez` had informed the group that they were starting an IRC channel called `#mobileforensics` in an effort "exchange ideas & have live discussions", as the post stated. I have been using forums for all of my internet life up until this point and I think subconsciously I was ready for something more, and this was it! I also knew that IRC was a longstanding tradition but I had never dabbled with it as I only had previous experience with messaging clients such as [AOL Instant Messenger (AIM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIM_(software)) and [MSN Messenger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Live_Messenger) at the time. 13 minutes after the post went out by `tupperwarez`, I was the first to respond in the thread that I had joined. 

Throughout the next year and a half, a small contingent of people totaling anywhere from 7-15 at any given time occupied this IRC channel. We became a really tightknit group of examiners who relied on each other's knowledge and expertise to navigate challenges in our everyday casework. These problems often would relate to performing advanced acquisition methods using Chip-Off, JTAG, or flasher boxes. The collaboration was exactly what I was looking for because through each other we were able to cast a wider net for knowledge that we sought for problems we were coming across in our everyday investigations. 

I recall utilizing an application called [HexChat](https://hexchat.github.io/) to access this IRC channel. I'd have HexChat open at all times along with my everyday workflow of software applications to perform my duties as a Detective. For those reading this who have not used IRC before, know that's its nowhere near as feature rich as Discord. Discord is much more modern and IRC has been around since the "early days" of the internet as we know it today. I bring this up because often we needed to share pictures with each other as an exhibit for a problem we were encountering during the acquisition or decoding process of a mobile device.

### Move to Discord

Truthfully, I had forgotten this detail I'm about to share but one of the moderators reminded me of it a couple of years ago and it all came back to me. One of the main catalysts for moving from IRC was the fact that I was really annoyed with having to upload a picture to imgur and share the link on the IRC channel as it seemed inefficient and the process grew stale for me. I had created a Discord account back in September 2016 to join various special interest servers so I had a fair amount of exposure to Discord's capabilities prior to the birthdate of the Digital Forensics Discord Server, which is March 26th, 2018. 

I recall having aspirations for a move to Discord months prior to March 2018. For those who didn't use Discord around this time, it was primarily a platform marketed towards gamers. Using it for things other than gaming wasn't the intended purpose at the time, but the functionality it had was everything I wanted in a chat client. Take all of the good features from every other chat application I had used up until that point in time and add even more quality of life features and an awesome mobile application, and I was sold. I didn't like how it wasn't as seamless to use IRC on my phone and combined with the inefficient image uploading process, Discord was a breath of fresh air.

I was reminded that the major push to move to Discord came from me mostly surrounding the image uploading process combined with the positive experiences I had with the platform in my personal life via special interest servers from September 2016 to March 2018. The call to move to Discord was met with nearly unanimous approval from members of the IRC channel. As a result, the Mobile Forensics Discord Server was created!

### Mobile Forensics Discord Server -> Digital Forensics Discord Server

The Mobile Forensics Discord Server enjoyed great success and rapid growth throughout its first year of existence. The server's growth was entirely driven by word of mouth and advertising on various Google Groups. The list of channels maintained in the server were driven by member requests which quickly expanded outside of mobile devices. Over time, it became increasingly apparent that branding the server as a Mobile Forensics server did not fully encompass the needs of the DFIR community. To the best of my research, the Mobile Forensics Discord Server was rebranded to the Digital Forensics Discord Server sometime around February 2019.

Since then, multiple channels have been added, renamed, and removed at the request of members.

### Member Growth

Throughout the 4 years (as of this writing), the Digital Forensics Discord Server has undergone substantial growth. Below are some major membership milestones that were mined from Announcements I made in the `#announcements` channel over time.

### Hosting the Magnet Virtual Summit 2020

In early 2020, shortly after the COVID-19 pandemic began, I was approached by representatives from Magnet Forensics inquiring about the possibility of providing a centralized location for attendees of the Magnet Virtual Summit 2020 to chat during presentations. Enthusiastically, we accepted the idea and began to plan the logistics of hosting what likely would become a large influx of members. I seem to recall nearly 1500 members joining during the month long Magnet Virtual Summit 2020.


In retrospect, it's clear that this was one of the first indicators that the server had "made it" in the eyes of the community.

Law Enforcement roles were separated by country from the early stages of the server for the purpose of delineating members from each other due to various legal considerations that may vary from one jurisdiction to another. Because of that, enumerating a list of the countries that a Law Enforcement role has been created for is likely the best way to establish the reach the Digital Forensics Discord Server has had on the DFIR community on a global level.

Countries with roles assigned for Law Enforcement personnel (as of May 2022):

* Albania
* Argentina
* Australia
* Austria
* Bangladesh
* Belgium
* Bosnia
* Brazil
* Canada
* Chile
* China
* Columbia
* Croatia
* Cyprus
* Czech Republic
* Denmark
* Dominican Republic
* Estonia
* Finland
* France
* Germany
* Greece
* Grenada
* Iceland
* India
* Indonesia
* Iraq
* Ireland
* Israel
* Italy
* Jamaica
* Japan
* Korea
* Latvia
* Lithuania
* Luxembourg
* Maldives
* Malaysia
* Malta
* Mongolia
* New Zealand
* Mauritius
* Mexico
* Monaco
* Nepal
* Nigeria
* Norway
* Pakistan
* Netherlands
* Poland
* Portugal
* Romania
* Royal Cayman Islands
* Russia
* Senegal
* Seychelles
* Singapore
* Slovakia
* Slovenia
* Spain
* Sweden
* Switzerland
* Taiwan
* Turkey
* United Arab Emirates
* United Kingdom
* Ukraine
* Uruguay
* USA
* Vietnam

To save you from counting, that's 70 countries with a dedicated Law Enforcement role. This means that someone who has identified themselves as someone who works in Law Enforcement in one of these countries has joined the server and had this role assigned to them. At least 1 person from each of these countries that at the time served in a Law Enforcement capacity have joined the Digital Forensics Discord Server. With [195 countries](https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/how-many-countries-are-in-the-world.html) recognized in the world as of the writing of this book, the server has a reach into approximately 36% of those! 

### Future

The Digital Forensics Discord Server will continue to live and thrive so long as the community wills it. 

For those who are new to administering Discord servers, one important thing to know is that only the member who is assigned as the Server Owner can delete the server. Currently, that person is me, Andrew Rathbun. In the interest of ensuring the Digital Forensics Discord Server lives far beyond all of us (assuming Discord is still around by that time), I've established a paper trail for any other moderators to follow should anything happen to me to where I will never be able to log back in to Discord. This paper trail will require a lot of effort and coordination with family members/friends of mine to access my password vault and many other necessary items in order to [Transfer Ownership](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/216273938-How-do-I-transfer-server-ownership) so that the server can live on without any administrative hiccups.
