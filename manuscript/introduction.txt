Welcome to the first crowdsourced digital forensics and incident response (DFIR) book! To my knowledge, this book is a first of its kind and hopefully not the last of its kind. To be very clear, this is not your traditional DFIR book. It's also not meant to be, and that's okay. I came up with the idea of the project, which ultimately became the book you are reading right now when I stumbled upon a website called Leanpub. Upon further research, I learned that books could be written on GitHub, a platform that has become a large part of my life since May 15. 2020 when I completed [my first commit](https://github.com/EricZimmerman/KapeFiles/commit/972774117b42e6fafbd06fd9b80d29e9f1ca629a)! As the Administrator of the Digital Forensics Discord Server, a community for which I am very fond and proud of, I felt combining the idea of writing a book with the members of the community that has given so much to me was a dream come true. This book is a grassroots effort from people who, to my knowledge, have no experience doing anything they're about to do in the chapters that succeed this Introduction chapter, and that's okay. This book isn't perfect, and it doesn't need to be. This book is documenting multiple people stepping outside of their shells, putting themselves out there, to share the knowledge they've gained through the lens they've been granted in their life with hopes to benefit the greater DFIR community. Additionally, I hope this book will inspire others to step outside their comfort zone and recognize that anyone can share knowledge, thus leaving the world a better place than what you found.

Before getting into the chapters this book offers, I want to cover the mantra behind this book for the reader to consider as they make their way through.

## Purpose of This Book

This book is purely a proof of concept that members of the Digital Forensics Discord Server undertook to show that a DFIR book can be:

### Crowdsourced

I love collaborating with people. I enjoy it when I can find people with the same mindset who "get it" and all they want to do is move the ball forward on something greater than themselves. Everyone contributing to this book "gets it", but that doesn't mean if you're reading this right now and haven't contributed to it, you do not "get it". I think it means you haven't found something that's resonated with you yet, or you're just not at a point in your career or, more importantly, your life to where you're able to give back through the various methods of giving back to the DFIR community, and that's okay. Ultimately, this book is greater than the sum of its parts, and I'm thrilled to help provide the opportunity for myself and others to collaborate with other members of the Digital Forensics Discord Server to create something genuinely community-driven from idea to published book.

### Open source

Since my first commit on GitHub in May 2020, I've been hooked on contributing to open-source projects. The ability for the community to see the process unfold from A-Z, including but not limited to the chapters being written, edited, and finalized for publication, is something I don't think we've seen yet, and I hope we see more of once this book is published and freely available for anyone to consume.

### Self-published

Self-publishing allows for as much control as possible for the content creators. Being able to self-publish on Leanpub enables the content creators to modify the content at a moment's notice without the red tape involved when dealing with a publisher. As a result, this book can be updated at any time with additional content until the authors deem the book to be complete, and thus a sequel would be necessary.

### Created using GitHub and Markua (modified version of Markdown)

This goes along with the open-source above. GitHub is a fantastic platform by which to contribute to open source projects. Markdown is commonly used on GitHub and Leanpub utilized a Leanpub-flavored version of Markdown called [Markua](http://markua.com/). Having gained a lot of experience with Markdown in my travels in various GitHub repos, the thought of authoring a book using Markdown was very appealing.

### Accessible

This particular book will be freely available on Leanpub [here](https://leanpub.com/TheHitchhikersGuidetoDFIRExperiencesFromBeginnersandExperts). It will never cost you anything. Share it far and wide!

### Considering all the above, a legitimate DFIR resource

Frankly, this may not be at the level of a college textbook, but it's also not meant to be. Again, this project is intended to provide a platform for previously unknown contributors in the DFIR community to provide the knowledge they've gained through research, experience, or otherwise. When one is passionate enough about a subject to where they'd volunteer to write a chapter for a book like this, enabling that person to spread their wings and put themselves out there for others to benefit from is an honor. Any errata in the chapters of this book will be addressed as they are identified, and since we control the publishing tempo, we (or you) can update the book at any time.

## Community Participation

One important aspect of creating this book was involving the community in deciding the [book title](https://github.com/Digital-Forensics-Discord-Server/TheHitchhikersGuidetoDFIRExperiencesFromBeginnersandExperts/issues/4) and the [book cover](https://github.com/Digital-Forensics-Discord-Server/TheHitchhikersGuidetoDFIRExperiencesFromBeginnersandExperts/issues/12).

### Book Title

Originally, this book was called CrowdsourcedDFIRBook as a working title. Multiple polls on [Google Forms](https://www.google.com/forms) were created with the following results:

#### Round 1

#### Round 2

### Book Cover

Originally, the book had no cover concept planned. As we got closer to the date of publishing the initial version of the book, we had discovered [Canva](https://www.canva.com/) allowed us to work up respectable book cover candidates. Naturally, the book cover was put to a vote that would be decided by the community. The first voting round contained 17 book cover candidates created using Canva.

#### Round 1

The following book covers were available as options during the first round of voting:

#### Round 2

The following book covers were decided as the top three in Round 1:

The final results for Round 2 were as follows:

Therefore, the book cover was chosen by the community for a book that was made by the community and for the community.

## Final Thoughts

I don't think any of the co-authors listed on the cover of this book ever thought they would be published authors. I can certainly say that is the case for myself. This project proved that the barrier to doing something as complicated as writing a book isn't as complex as it could be, primarily thanks to Leanpub. For all we know, the next prominent name in the DFIR world may have gotten their start from volunteering a simple chapter to this book which sparked an interest in continuing the path of knowledge sharing, content development, and overall DFIR community betterment. Only time will tell! Either way, I'm proud of those who stepped up to do something uncomfortable, something that requires effort and follow-through, and something they can ultimately be proud of accomplishing when all is said and done. Ultimately, the authors win, the other contributors win, and most importantly, the community wins!

Enjoy the book!
