# Chapter 0 - Introduction

Welcome to the first crowdsourced digital forensics and incident response (DFIR) book! To my knowledge, this book is a first of its kind and hopefully not the last of its kind. To be very clear, this is not your traditional DFIR book. It’s also not meant to be and that’s okay. I came up with the idea of the project which ultimately became the book you are reading right now when I stumbled upon a website called Leanpub. Upon further research, I learned that books can be written in GitHub, which is a platform that has become a large part of my life since May 15. 2020 when I completed [my first commit](https://github.com/EricZimmerman/KapeFiles/commit/972774117b42e6fafbd06fd9b80d29e9f1ca629a)! As the Administrator of the Digital Forensics Discord Server, a community for which I am very fond and proud of, I felt combining the idea of writing a book with the members of the community that has given so much to me was a dream come true. This book is a grassroots effort from people who, to my knowledge, have no experience doing anything they’re about to do in the chapters that succeed this Introduction chapter, and that’s okay. This book isn’t perfect, and it doesn’t need to be. This book is documenting multiple people stepping outside of their shell, putting themselves out there, to share the knowledge they’ve gained through the lens of which they’ve been granted in their life with hopes to benefit the greater DFIR community as a whole. Additionally, I personally hope this book will inspire others to step outside of their comfort zone and recognize that anyone can share knowledge thus leaving the world a better place than what you found it.

Before getting into the chapters this book offers, I want to cover the mantra behind this book for the reader to consider as they make their way through.

## Purpose of this book

This book is purely a proof of concept that members of the Digital Forensics Discord Server undertook to show that a DFIR book can be:

	1. Crowdsourced
	2. Open source
	3. Self-published
	4. Created using GitHub and Markua (modified version of Markdown)
	5. Fully transparent as to the writing and editing process prior to publication
	6. Considering all the above, a legitimate DFIR resource
	
I don't think any of the co-authors listed on the cover of this book ever thought they would be a published author. I can certainly say that is the case for myself. What this project proved to me is that that barrier to do something as complicated as writing a book really isn't as complicated as it could be, mostly thanks to Leanpub. For all we know, the next major name in the DFIR world may have gotten their start from volunteering a simple chapter to this book which sparked an interest in continuing down the path of knowledge sharing, content development, and overall world betterment. Only time will tell! Either way, I’m proud of all of those who stepped up to do something uncomfortable, something that requires effort and follow-through, and something they can ultimately be proud of accomplishing when all is said and done.
