## The Artisanal Approach

Most mobile forenisc examinations involve the use of third party tools to extract and decode information stored whitin targeted devices. What happens when the tool presents little to nothing of what is expected? What to do when the targeted app seems to not exist as far as the tool is concerned?

A big part of digital forensics involves what I call The Artisanal Approach. The Oxford Languages dictionary defines artisanal as: 

		
		ar·ti·san·al
		/ärˈtēzən(ə)l/
		adjective
		- relating to or characteristic of an artisan.
		"artisanal skills"
		- (of a product, especially food or drink) made in a traditional or non-mechanized way.
		"artisanal cheeses"
