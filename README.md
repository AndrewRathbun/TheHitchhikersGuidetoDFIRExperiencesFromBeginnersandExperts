# The Hitchhikers Guide to DFIR: Experiences From Beginners and Experts

Check out the book on Leanpub [here](https://leanpub.com/TheHitchhikersGuidetoDFIRExperiencesFromBeginnersandExperts).

## What is this?

A DFIR book:

1. Being written on GitHub
2. Being edited on GitHub
3. Being self published through Leanpub
4. Being written by multiple co-authors collaboratively

## Why?

This is a proof of concept and a great first step for providing a different method of knowledge sharing within the DFIR space. 

## When will it be done?

Sometime this year (2022) for sure. Hopefully by end of the summer? Regardless, the writing and editing process will be fully transparent to the public! Check out the [Milestones](https://github.com/Digital-Forensics-Discord-Server/CrowdsourcedDFIRBook/milestones) to see where we're at. Stay tuned!
