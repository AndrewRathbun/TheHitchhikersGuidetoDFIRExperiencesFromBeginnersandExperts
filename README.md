# Crowdsourced DFIR Book (working title)

## What is this?

A DFIR book:

1. Being written on GitHub
2. Being edited on GitHub
3. Being self published through Leanpub
4. Being written by multiple co-authors collaboratively

## Why?

This is a proof of concept and a great first step for providing a different method of knowledge sharing within the DFIR space. 

## When will it be done?

Sometime this year (2022) for sure. The writing and editing process will be fully transparent to the public! Stay tuned!
