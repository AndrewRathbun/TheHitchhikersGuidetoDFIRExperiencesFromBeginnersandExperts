# The Hitchhikers Guide to DFIR: Experiences From Beginners and Experts

Check out the book on Leanpub [here](https://leanpub.com/TheHitchhikersGuidetoDFIRExperiencesFromBeginnersandExperts).

## What is this?

A DFIR book:

1. Being written on GitHub
2. Being edited on GitHub
3. Being self published through Leanpub
4. Being written by multiple co-authors collaboratively

## Why?

This is a proof of concept and a great first step for providing a different method of knowledge sharing within the DFIR space. 

## When will it be done?

Version 1 will go live by mid-August! From the beginning, the writing and editing process has been fully transparent to the public! Check out the [Milestones](https://github.com/Digital-Forensics-Discord-Server/CrowdsourcedDFIRBook/milestones) to see where we're at. Stay tuned!
