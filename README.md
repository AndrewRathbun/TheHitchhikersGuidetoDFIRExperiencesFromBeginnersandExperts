# CrowdsourcedDFIRBook
The official repo for a project involving a crowdsourced DFIR book. The main purpose of this book is to give anyone interested an opportunity to write a chapter of a book to get their name out there, get a publication on their resume with an actual ISBN number, and ideally lower the bar for people to contribute something back to the DFIR Community. Want to write a chapter? Let me know and let's make it happen!
